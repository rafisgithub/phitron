Dear KAZ Team,

I’m writing to express my interest in joining your team — either as a junior developer or even as an intern — as I transition into Python development.

I have over 3 years of experience as a full-stack developer using PHP and Laravel, during which I’ve developed 20+ software projects, including APIs and full-scale web applications. While I’m still building my depth in Python and Django, I have a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, and I’m confident in my ability to quickly pick up new technologies.

What excites me most about KAZ is your culture of mentorship and growth. I would love the opportunity to learn from your experienced team while contributing with the skills I already have.

If there’s a junior role or internship pathway available, I’d be genuinely excited to be considered. Please find my CV attached.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
